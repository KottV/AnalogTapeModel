[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel.svg?token=Ub9niJrqG1Br1qaaxp7E&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel)

This repository contains an academic paper and corresponding
computer simulations and implementations for a signal processing
system that performs real-time physical modeling for an analog
tape machine.

This work is part of a class project for [Music 420](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/420/) at Stanford
University (CCRMA), and is planned to be presented at the
[2019 DAFx conference](http://dafx2019.bcu.ac.uk/).
